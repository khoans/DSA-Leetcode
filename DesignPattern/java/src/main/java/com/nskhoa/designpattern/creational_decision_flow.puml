:Do you need exactly one instance of a class for the entire application lifetime?;

if (Yes) then (yes)
  :Is global access required?;
  if (Yes) then (yes)

  :Is object creation expensive but you have existing instances?;
  if (Yes) then (yes)
    :Can you clone/copy safely?;
    if (Yes) then (yes)

      note right: When cloning is cheaper than creation

    if (Yes) then (yes)
