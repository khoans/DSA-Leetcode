As a Java backend developer,

It will be good if you have an understanding of the below 40 topics👇

1. CAP Theorem
2. Consistency Models
3. Distributed System Architectures
4. Socket Programming (TCP/IP and UDP)
5. HTTP and RESTful APIs
6. Remote Procedure Call (RPC) - gRPC, Thrift, RMI
7. Message Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ, JMS)
8. Java Concurrency (ExecutorService, Future, ForkJoinPool)
9. Thread Safety and Synchronization
10. Java Memory Model
11. Distributed Databases (Cassandra, MongoDB, HBase)
12. Data Sharding and Partitioning
13. Caching Mechanisms (Redis, Memcached, Ehcache)
14. Zookeeper for Distributed Coordination
15. Consensus Algorithms (Paxos, Raft)
16. Distributed Locks (Zookeeper, Redis)
17. Spring Boot and Spring Cloud for Microservices
18. Service Discovery (Consul, Eureka, Kubernetes)
19. API Gateways (Zuul, NGINX, Spring Cloud Gateway)
20. Inter-service Communication (REST, gRPC, Kafka)
21. Circuit Breakers and Retry Patterns (Hystrix, Resilience4j)
22. Load Balancing (NGINX, Kubernetes, Ribbon)
23. Failover Mechanisms
24. Distributed Transactions (2PC, Saga Pattern)
25. Logging and Distributed Tracing (ELK Stack, Jaeger, Zipkin)
26. Monitoring and Metrics (Prometheus, Grafana, Micrometer)
27. Alerting Systems
28. Authentication and Authorization (OAuth, JWT)
29. Encryption (SSL/TLS)
30. Rate Limiting and Throttling
31. Apache Kafka for Distributed Streaming
32. Apache Zookeeper for Coordination
33. In-memory Data Grids (Hazelcast, Infinispan)
34. Akka for Actor-based Concurrency
35. Event-Driven Architecture: Event sourcing and CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation).
36. Cluster Management: Kubernetes for container orchestration.
37. Cloud-Native Development: Using cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure), and serverless computing (e.g., AWS Lambda).
38. Distributed Data Processing: Frameworks like Apache Spark or Apache Flink for large-scale data processing.
39. GraphQL: Alternative to REST for inter-service communication.
40. JVM Tuning for Distributed Systems: Memory management and performance tuning in distributed environments.
