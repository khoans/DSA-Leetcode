/*
Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and using only constant extra space.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3,3,3,3]
Output: 3


Constraints:

1 <= n <= 105
nums.length == n + 1
1 <= nums[i] <= n
All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.


Follow up:

How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in nums?
Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?
