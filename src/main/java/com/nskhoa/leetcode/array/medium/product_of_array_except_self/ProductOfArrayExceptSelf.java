Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]


Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 105
-30 <= nums[i] <= 30
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.


Follow up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

    Approach 1: Left and Right product lists

    Complexity analysis

    Time complexity : O(N) where N represents the number of elements in the input array. We use one iteration to construct the array L, one to construct the array R and one last to construct the answer array using L and R.
    Space complexity : O(N) used up by the two intermediate arrays that we constructed to keep track of product of elements to the left and right.

    Complexity analysis

    Time complexity : O(N) where N represents the number of elements in the input array. We use one iteration to construct the array L, one to update the array answer.
    Space complexity : O(1) since don't use any additional array for our computations. The problem statement mentions that using the answer array doesn't add to the space complexity.
