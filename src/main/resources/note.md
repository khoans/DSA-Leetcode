## Final Notes
- **Phase 1** builds your fundamentals with many NeetCode 150 easy classics.
- **Phase 2** deepens medium-level skills (covering the full NeetCode 150 list plus additional medium challenges) with some DP/greedy and light graph/tree practice.
- **Phase 3** shifts focus away from advanced DP/graph topics and emphasizes arrays, sliding window/two pointers, trees, and heaps — common interview topics.
- **Phase 4** simulates FAANG‑style timed mock interviews and mixed reviews focused on these key areas.

Feel free to adjust the pacing or swap in extra practice problems as needed. Happy coding and best of luck with your interview preparation!
